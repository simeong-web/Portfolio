Description:
***
This is my Front-End Developer Portfolio, focusing on the most recent developments so far in my journey to become a fully competent, full stack JavaScript Developer. There are a few projects still left out ( mainly React ), which I plan to introduce as soon as I'm confident working on large scale projects. Ultimately, my goal is to work with React/Redux, as I find it currently the quickest and most effective tools for enterprises of any scale for building their front-end.
